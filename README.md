# Personal projects

This repo is where I store all my personal projects. Below is a brief description of each project/file in the repo.

_julia.py_ â€“ a program that takes user input of a complex number, the dimensions of the resulting graph, and the resolution of said Julia set. 

_complex+number.png_ Pictures that represent examples of Julia sets generated by julia.py.
