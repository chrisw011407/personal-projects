# Personal projects

This repo is where I store all my personal projects. Below is a brief description of each project/file in the repo. Project categories are organized alphabetically.


# Conic fitting

_conicfits.py_ – a program that takes a set of data, organises it, then uses a conic fitting method based on polar n-dir geometric distance to get a best fit. Done as an assignment for Differential Geometry. 

_conicfit example.png_ – Plot of the conic fit over some data.


# Julia sets

_julia.py_ – a program that takes user input of a complex number, the dimensions of the resulting graph, and the resolution of said Julia set. 

_complex+number.png_ – Pictures that represent examples of Julia sets generated by julia.py.
